1," With examples, provide evidence of your experience in working with a multi-disciplinary team on agile projects of similar size, complexity and timelines as outlined in the Government Service Standard"," Marvell Consulting has supplied a multidisciplinary agile team of ten members over two years to research, design and deliver a multi-tiered e-licensing system for regulating the use of Animals in Science (ASL) for the Home Office (HO). The end users of the service are establishments from academia and industry in the UK. The service has passed three alpha assessments and is currently in private Beta.

We conducted accessibility testing so that components of the implementation could be used across a range of assistive devices. As a result, we implemented an accessible country selector so that screen reader users can complete a form in five minutes.
Our solution was GDPR compliant. Only the necessary personal information was shared securely with UKVI case workers in order to allow the processing of the user’s enquiry.

Our management of this service has given us knowledge of AddressBase and the administration of this data. Limitations are largely from the Ordnance Survey service such as no ability to diff datasets, data integrity issues, disjointed user experience to obtain the data.
To ensure successful data loads into postcodeinfo a dry run is performed in a test environment before running against production.

For Animals in Science, we redesigned the project licence application from a ‘one size fits all’ ineffective form to an adaptable and effective questionnaire that met the needs of the regulator and the scientists. We prototyped three key sections over four months with each section being iterated four times until we were confident that the solution meets user needs. For example, users were writing a poor non technical summary of their work at the end of an eighty page application. We helped them to write it progressively, designed prompts and auto-populated answers where possible. Also, reduced the number of questions.

Delivery was achieved using Agile delivery: fortnightly sprint planning, ""show and tell"", retrospectives and daily stand ups for the delivery team.
Scope was managed via continuous refinement and prioritisation of the backlog. Progress towards the delivery deadline was monitored and managed by plotting ""burnup chart"" of work done against total work to do in a backlog of items estimated for relative complexity.

This included filtering out data that isn’t valid, de-duplicating records (due to system errors in GRO) and collecting records for later analysis which don’t meet the required schema. This data is then analysed and shared with GRO to ensure they clean up the master data records to reduce occurrences in future replications.

Users had commercial concerns with being fully open in their responses and needed to ensure  protection of intellectual property information when applying for a licence to the HO. We built a system so that only users with appropriate permissions could access sensitive data even within the same establishment as it can often host projects for competing companies.
